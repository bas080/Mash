# Installation

First you need to install stack.

As mentioned in the [stack install
guide](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) you can
use the following command to install stack.

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
  # or
wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

Mash is a stack script. The script is located at `./mash.hs` and is executable.
Make sure to add this script to your path by linking or copying it to a bin
directory.
